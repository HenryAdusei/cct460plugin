DESCRIPTION
Once the plugin has been installed, a custom post type, a widget, and a shortcode will be available. Through the use of a custom post type with the widget, or the shortcode, you should be able to display customized posts. In general, both the widget and the shortcode will display these posts on your webpage via the Featured Image inserted in them, and their titles. To view the content of the posts, simply click the image or title. To enable this plugin:
	1. Log in to your Wordpress site, then enter the Dashboard menu.
	2. Click the Plugins heading, or the Installed Plugins subheading.
	3. On the Plugins page, find the Authentic Bikes Plugin, and simply press the "activate" button.

CUSTOM POST TYPE
The custom post type in this plugin is "Featured Bikes." This was designed for our client Authentic Bikes in order to show any featured products they may want to promote to their viewers. In order to utilize this custom post type:
	1. Once in the Dashboard menu, mouse-over the Featured Bikes heading in the menu. You will see there are two subsections, consisting of Featured Bikes, and Add New.
	2. Clicking on Featured Bikes will take you to a list of all existing Featured Bike posts. Clicking Add New will allow you to add a new Featured Bike post. 
	3. Posts in this custom post type are written in a similar fashion to regular posts.
	4. After inserting any content in the post, insert the Featured Image you would like the posts to display when shown using the widget or shortcode. This can be done by pressing the Featured Image button on the right side of the page.
	5. Press Publish on the right side of the page, and your post will have been created.
	

WIDGET
Once you have created Featured Bikes posts, they can all be displayed in the widget which will be inserted into the sidebar or footer. In order to use the widget:
	1. Once in the dashboard menu, enter the Appearance section, then the Widgets subsection.
	2. Under the Available Widgets area, one of the available widgets should be Authentic Widget. Drag this widget into the sidebar, or into another section.

	4. Enter the Settings section on the dashboard, then the Permalinks section.
	5. Do not make any changes, simply press Save Changes. This will allow Wordpress to develop URLs for the content of your custom posts.
